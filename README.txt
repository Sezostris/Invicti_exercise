Hello!

## External requirements
In this project, I've made use of the following external libraries:
`HTTP Requests`: https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib
Since cpp-httplib is header-only, I've simply included it in the headers directory.

`Parsing HTML`: https://github.com/lexborisov/myhtml


## Installation:
- Download, compile myhtml. Provide the correct path to it in CMakeLists.txt
- In CLI:
```bash
cmake .
make
```

3. Launch the application
```bash
./main
```
